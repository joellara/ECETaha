## Instructions
In the included zip file you can find all the required files to run the program except the vrpn library, the reason to this was that it contained a lot of files and wasn't possible to upload all the files. To download it, go to [VRPN Webpage](https://github.com/vrpn/vrpn/releases) and download the required version.
### Testing
In order to test the program do the following steps:  
1. Run the vrpn server exe in the the [folder](./vrpn_server)
2. Download vrpn and put it the root folder with vrpn name
3. Open the solution inside [vrpn_mouse](./vrpn_mouse) and run the main file
4. Test the application using the mouse
5. (Optional) If you would like you can change the location on the server by replacing the correct line.
